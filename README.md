# Private Pet Tracker

Private Pet Tracker is a privacy-preserving application that leverages Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to ensure your pet's location data remains secure and accessible only by you. With this innovative solution, pet owners can track their furry friends without the fear of their data being exposed to unauthorized access.

## The Problem

In the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), the data generated by pet tracking devices is often transmitted in cleartext, creating significant privacy risks. Pet owners face the threat of malicious actors intercepting sensitive GPS data, leading to potential stalking, abuse, or theft. As pet ownership rises, the need for a secure tracking solution has never been more critical. Cleartext data not only compromises pet safety, but it also poses a broader risk to owner privacy.

## The Zama FHE Solution

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables computation on encrypted data, meaning that sensitive GPS information can be processed securely without ever exposing the underlying data in cleartext. By using the Zama infrastructure, particularly the fhevm framework, the Private Pet Tracker ensures that even when your pet's location data is being analyzed or used for tracking, it remains securely encrypted. This approach provides a robust layer of security, ensuring only authorized users can decrypt and view the actual locations of their pets.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Data Security**: All GPS data is encrypted, ensuring that only authorized users can access their pet's location.
- 🐾 **Real-time Tracking**: Get updates on your pet's location and track its movement in real time while maintaining privacy.
- ✅ **Authorization Mechanism**: Only pet owners can decrypt and view location data, preventing unauthorized access.
- 📊 **Historical Tracking**: Access a log of your pet's past locations and routes without compromising privacy.
- 🌐 **Integrative IoT Functionality**: Designed specifically for IoT applications, enabling seamless integration with various pet collars and tracking devices.

## Technical Architecture & Stack

The technical stack for the Private Pet Tracker application includes:

- **Core Privacy Engine**: Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, leveraging:
  - **fhevm**: Used for processing encrypted inputs and maintaining privacy.
- **Backend**: Leveraging cloud-based infrastructure for quick access and processing.
- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for easy access and tracking capabilities.

## Smart Contract / Core Logic (Code Snippet)

Below is a simplified example of how we utilize Zama's technology for our smart contracts. This example demonstrates how to securely track a pet's location:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "path_to_fhevm.sol";

contract PrivatePetTracker {
    mapping(address => EncryptedLocation) private userLocations;

    function updateLocation(uint64 latitude, uint64 longitude) public {
        // Encrypt location data using TFHE
        EncryptedLocation encLocation = TFHE.encrypt(latitude, longitude);
        userLocations[msg.sender] = encLocation;
    }

    function getLocation() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
        // Decrypt location data for the authorized user
        EncryptedLocation encLocation = userLocations[msg.sender];
        return TFHE.decrypt(encLocation);
    }
}
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm (for JavaScript projects)
- Python and pip (for Python projects)

### Installing Dependencies

To get started, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install fhevm
```
or
```bash
pip install concrete-ml
```

This will install Zama's FHE library, which is essential for processing encrypted data.

## Build & Run

To compile the smart contracts and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the application, allowing you to track your pet's location securely and privately.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to extend our gratitude to Zama for providing open-source FHE primitives that make this project possible. Their commitment to enhancing data privacy plays a crucial role in enabling innovative solutions like the Private Pet Tracker.
